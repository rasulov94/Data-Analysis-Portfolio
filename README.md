### Project: *Cafe market research*
## Project description
You’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so you and your partners decide to try to attract investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will you be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
You’re an analytics guru, so your partners have asked you to prepare some market research. You have open-source data on restaurants in LA.

### Goal of the Project
Draw an overall conclusion and provide recommendations on restaurant type and number of seats. Comment on the possibility of developing a chain.<br>
Make a presentation of your research to share with investors.

 - Identify top opportunities
 - Present findings
